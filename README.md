## Introduction

The Stock Market Simulator is a C++ project that simulates a local stock market environment. It allows users to explore the world of stock trading without the risks associated with real investments. Users can buy and sell virtual stocks, monitor their portfolio, and experience the fluctuations of stock prices.

## Features

- **Virtual Stocks:** The simulator provides a range of virtual stocks with various attributes such as name, symbol, price, and historical data.

- **Portfolio Management:** Users can create portfolios, buy/sell stocks, and track their holdings and profits/losses.

- **Stock Price Simulation:** The simulator simulates random fluctuations in stock prices based on predefined parameters, providing a realistic trading experience.

## Technologies Used

- C++: The primary programming language for developing the simulator.
- Object-Oriented Design: Using classes and objects to represent stocks, portfolios, and users.
- Random Number Generation: For simulating stock price fluctuations.
- Command Line Interface: Interaction with the simulator through the terminal.
- Version Control: Managing the project with Git.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-simulator.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:** Navigate to the project directory and compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler. For example:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o stock_simulator
   ```

3. **Run the Simulator:** Execute the compiled binary to start the simulator.
   ```
   ./stock_simulator
   ```

## Usage

1. **Menu Navigation:** Use the terminal menu to navigate through options such as viewing available stocks, creating portfolios, buying/selling stocks, and analyzing stock data.

2. **Buying and Selling:** Choose stocks to buy or sell, specify quantities, and see the impact on your portfolio and balance.

3. **Portfolio Analysis:** Monitor the performance of your portfolio over time, view historical price charts, and adjust your strategies accordingly.
